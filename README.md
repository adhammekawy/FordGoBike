## Ford GoBike Project
# Project Overview:

The Ford GoBike project focuses on exploring and analyzing bike-sharing data from the Ford GoBike system in the San Francisco Bay Area. The goal of the project is to understand user behavior, identify trends, and provide actionable insights to improve bike-sharing services.

# Key Objectives:

Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns in bike usage, including peak usage times, popular routes, and user demographics.
Visualize the data using various exploratory data visualization techniques to communicate findings effectively.
Identify factors that influence bike usage, such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week.
Data Sources: The project utilizes publicly available datasets from Ford GoBike, which include trip data, user demographics, and bike station information.

# Methodology:

Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to explore relationships between variables and identify trends.
Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests to validate findings and draw conclusions about user behavior.
Visualization: Create polished visualizations to present insights in a clear and engaging manner.
Tools and Technologies:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
Data visualization libraries for creating informative plots
Outcomes:

Insights into bike-sharing usage patterns that can help improve service offerings and operational efficiency.
Recommendations for enhancing user experience based on data-driven findings.
